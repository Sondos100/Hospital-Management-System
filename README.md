# üè• Hospital Management System (HMS)

The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a C++-based software application developed as part of the Summer Software Internship Program at FuzeTek Company.

Its primary goal is to provide an efficient, modular solution for managing core hospital operations, including patient lifecycle management, doctor assignment, appointment scheduling, medical record handling, and emergency case processing. The project is guided by a formally defined Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and is implemented following object-oriented programming principles and the use of standard data structures (stacks, queues, vectors).

# üìå Project Scope

The HMS project is structured into progressive stages to simulate a real-world software development cycle:

1. Requirements & Design

Analysis of the problem domain using the SRS.

Identification of system actors, use cases, and functional/non-functional requirements.

High-level design of classes (Patient, Doctor, Hospital) and their interactions.



2. Implementation

Development of core functionality in C++ using clean, modular code.

Patient operations: registration, admission, discharge, and medical history.

Doctor operations: specialization assignment, appointment queue management.

Hospital operations: emergency handling, patient/doctor info display, system records.



3. Testing & Validation

Unit testing for all implemented functions.

Integration testing across modules (patients ‚Üî doctors ‚Üî hospital).

Verification against SRS-defined requirements.



4. Optimization & Deployment

Performance tuning (queue/stack efficiency, memory handling).

Security and maintainability enhancements.

Preparation for user acceptance testing (UAT).

# üéØ Internship Context

This project is part of the FuzeTek Summer Internship Program, designed to give interns hands-on experience with:

Real-world software engineering workflows.

Agile development and task distribution.

Modular design and code maintainability.

Testing-driven development.


The HMS prototype serves as both a practical training project and a scalable foundation for more advanced healthcare management systems.
