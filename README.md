# üè• Hospital Management System (HMS)

A C++-based hospital management prototype developed during the FuzeTek Summer Internship.  The system manages patients, doctors, appointments, medical records, and emergencies using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and fundamental data structures.  
It is built according to the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and follows the full software lifecycle from design to testing.
